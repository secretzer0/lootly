```

#### `search_items` - Quick Discovery
**Best for:** Rapid scanning and keyword variations
```

```

## ‚è∞ Strategic Timing Guide

### üïò Best Times to Hunt for Deals:

#### **Sunday Night Special (8-11 PM EST)**
- **Why:** Most auctions end Sunday nights
- **Strategy:** Snipe multiple auctions simultaneously
- **Tools:** `find_items_advanced` with "ending within 2 hours"
- **Risk:** High competition, set bidding limits

#### **Tuesday-Thursday Mornings**
- **Why:** Lowest competition from casual bidders
- **Strategy:** Target Buy It Now items with Best Offer
- **Tools:** `search_items` + price filtering
- **Opportunity:** Business hours = fewer bidders

#### **Holiday Aftermath (Jan 2-15, Dec 26-31)**
- **Why:** People selling Christmas gifts, clearing inventory
- **Strategy:** Search "new with tags" + "gift"
- **Categories:** Electronics, clothing, home goods
- **Bonus:** Returns season = unopened items

#### **End of Season Sales**
- **Why:** Sellers clearing seasonal inventory
- **Examples:** Winter coats (March), swimwear (September)
- **Strategy:** Search seasonal keywords + "clearance"

## üîç Advanced Deal Hunting Strategies

### The Misspelling Strategy
**Concept:** Find items with typos that fewer people discover

**Common Misspellings to Search:**
- Luxury brands: "Gucci" ‚Üí "Guchi", "Louis Vuitton" ‚Üí "Louis Vitton"
- Electronics: "Samsung" ‚Üí "Samsumg", "Nintendo" ‚Üí "Nintindo"
- Watches: "Rolex" ‚Üí "Rollex", "Omega" ‚Üí "Omaga"

**Implementation:**
```
1. Use `search_items` with intentional misspellings
2. Sort by "Time: ending soonest"
3. Cross-reference with correctly spelled listings
4. Identify significant price gaps
```

### The Incomplete Search Strategy
**Concept:** Search partial model numbers or generic terms

**Examples:**
- "iPhone 14" instead of "iPhone 14 Pro Max 256GB"
- "Jordan sneakers" instead of "Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG"
- "Vintage watch" instead of "1960s Omega Seamaster"

### The Auction Sniping Strategy
**Concept:** Bid in final seconds of auctions

**Best Practices:**
1. **Research first:** Know the item's market value
2. **Set hard limits:** Never exceed your maximum
3. **Multiple targets:** Bid on several similar items
4. **Timing tools:** Bid in last 10-15 seconds
5. **Internet speed:** Ensure stable connection

### The Bundle Breaking Strategy
**Concept:** Buy lots/bundles, keep what you want, sell the rest

**Process:**
1. Find bundles with one item you want + others
2. Calculate: (Bundle price √∑ Number of items) = Cost per item
3. Estimate resale value of unwanted items
4. Net cost = Bundle price - Estimated resale value
