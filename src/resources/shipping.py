"""eBay shipping reference guide and rate estimates.

IMPORTANT: This resource provides REFERENCE DATA ONLY for shipping planning.
Actual shipping rates vary significantly based on:
- Exact package dimensions and weight
- Origin and destination ZIP codes  
- Current carrier rates and fuel surcharges
- Account-specific discounts

Always use official carrier calculators or eBay's shipping calculator for accurate pricing.

This resource contains:
- Common shipping service options and typical cost ranges
- Delivery time estimates by service
- Weight/size limits and restrictions
- Best practices for different item types
- Important warnings about each service

Note: eBay does not provide a shipping rates API. This reference data helps sellers
understand their options, but should not be used for final pricing decisions.
