# or explicitly:
LOOTLY_TRANSPORT=stdio uv run lootly
```
- Direct process communication
- Lowest latency and overhead
- Recommended for desktop AI assistants

#### SSE (Server-Sent Events)
**Best for**: Web applications, browser integration
```bash
LOOTLY_TRANSPORT=sse LOOTLY_PORT=8000 uv run lootly
```
- Real-time web streaming
- Browser-compatible event stream
- Perfect for web dashboard integration

#### HTTP
**Best for**: REST API access, microservice architecture
```bash
LOOTLY_TRANSPORT=streamable-http LOOTLY_PORT=8000 uv run lootly
```
- Standard HTTP request/response
- Easy integration with existing systems
- Ideal for server-to-server communication

### Docker Deployment
